"""
Configuration manager for download paths.

This module handles persistent storage of the user's preferred download directory
using a JSON configuration file stored in the project root. It provides both
setter functionality (when a path is provided) and getter functionality
(when called without arguments).

def configuring_path(path: str) -> str:
    """
    Manage persistent storage location for downloaded audio files.

    This function acts as both a setter and getter for the download directory.
    - When a valid path is provided: saves it to config.json and confirms success
    - When an empty string or falsy value is provided: reads and displays current config

    Args:
        path (str): Directory path to save files. If empty or falsy, acts as getter
                   and returns the current configuration. If provided, acts as setter
                   and saves the path to config.json.

    Returns:
        str: Status message indicating either:
             - Success confirmation with config file location (setter mode)
             - Current configuration display with download directory (getter mode)

    Raises:
        SystemExit: Exits with code 1 in the following cases:
                    - Config file exists but saved path is invalid/missing
                    - Config file is corrupted (invalid JSON format)
                    - Config file doesn't exist (when in getter mode)

    Note:
        The configuration file is stored as 'config.json' in the project root
        directory (one level above the 'modules' folder). The file uses UTF-8
        encoding and pretty-printed JSON formatting for human readability.
