"""
Audio downloader module using yt-dlp.

This module handles downloading audio from YouTube videos and extracting
the audio track to high-quality M4A format. It reads the download path
from a JSON configuration file and uses yt-dlp with FFmpeg for audio processing.

Requirements:
    - FFmpeg must be installed on the system and available in PATH
    - A valid configuration file must exist with a 'path' key pointing
      to an existing directory for downloads

    Extract audio track from YouTube video and save as high-quality M4A file.

    This function performs the following steps:
        1. Locates and validates the configuration file (config.json)
        2. Reads the saved download directory path from the config
        3. Generates a random User-Agent to avoid rate limiting
        4. Configures yt-dlp with optimal audio extraction settings
        5. Downloads and extracts audio using FFmpeg

    Args:
        url (str): Complete YouTube URL. Accepts various formats:
                   - https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
                   - https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID
                   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID

    Returns:
        None: The function prints status messages to the console and exits
              with appropriate error codes on failure.

    Note:
        - Requires FFmpeg to be installed on the system for audio extraction.
        - The download path must be configured first using the config command.
        - Audio is downloaded at 256 kbps bitrate in M4A format (AAC codec).
        - The configuration file is expected at ../config.json relative to
          this module's location.

    Raises:
        SystemExit: Exits with code 1 on configuration or download errors,
                    code 0 on successful completion or keyboard interrupt.
