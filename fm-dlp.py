"""
Entry point for the fm-dlp YouTube Music Downloader.

This module initializes the CLI interface using the 'clite' library and
defines the main commands: search, download, config, and help. It serves
as the main entry point for the application and handles command-line
argument parsing and dispatch.

Architecture:
    - Commands are defined as methods decorated with @fm_dlp.command()
    - Each command delegates to its corresponding module function
    - The CLI framework automatically generates --help for each command
    - Type hints are used for automatic argument parsing and validation

Dependencies:
    - clite: CLI framework for command dispatch and argument parsing
    - modules.searching: YouTube search functionality
    - modules.downloader: Audio download functionality
    - modules.configer: Configuration management
    - modules.helper: Help menu generation

    Search for videos on YouTube and display results in a formatted list.

    This command connects to YouTube (via scrapetube), performs a search with the
    given query, filters results to ensure the query appears in the title or channel name,
    and displays up to 'limit' results with titles, channels, dates, views, durations, and URLs.

    Args:
        query (str): The search term(s) to look for on YouTube. This is a required parameter.
        limit (int): Maximum number of raw results to fetch. Defaults to 10.
                    Note that filtering may reduce the actual number of displayed results.

    Returns:
        None: Results are printed directly to the console with color formatting.

        fm-dlp search "rick astley" --limit=5

    Requires FFmpeg to be installed on the system.

    Args:
        url (str): The full YouTube URL. Supported formats:

    Example:
        fm-dlp download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

    Note:
        The download path must be configured first using the 'config' command.

    Args:
        path (str): The directory path where audio files should be saved.
